# alien-invasion
A game that pits you against a descending fleet of aliens which you have to prevent from landing.

This program was motivated by Eric Matthes's "Python Crash Course" which was an extremely fun guide to programming in Python and I highly recommend! The game provides you with one ship (and an extra life) to try and shoot down the advancing aliens. If an alien hits your ship or lands you lose a life. As you advance in level the game will also scale in difficulty. In addition to the functions defined by Eric Matthes I've added functionality that lets you choose between a hard mode which gives you only three bullets at a time and an easy mode which lets you unleash a devastating sonic blast. (I recommend trying the hard mode and then the easy mode). Also, if you want to restart at any time, pressing the 'r' key will do it.

To move left and right use the arrow keys and use the space bar to fire.
